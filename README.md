# Plant_Factory-arduinoUno
arduino uno以及薪火的配套组件实现植物工厂


Use an Arduino Uno microcontroller and complementary modules from Xinhuo to build the control system for a small-scale plant factory.

The Arduino can automate environmental factors like lighting, humidity, nutrient dosing, etc. Xinhuo provides sensors, relays, pumps, and other components to interface with the Arduino and create a complete system to monitor and control the plant growth environment.

With the simple programming capability of the Arduino platform, this provides an accessible way to prototype and test an indoor cultivation setup with precise control over the key plant growth parameters. The modular Xinhuo components enable the system to be customized to specific crop needs.

Overall, the Arduino and Xinhuo modules can be used together to create an automated plant growth system with capabilities similar to a commercial-scale plant factory. This allows hands-on experimentation with the technology on a small budget.
